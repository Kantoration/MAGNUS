Daily Messaging brief






Document Purpose:


This specification outlines the end-to-end process and technical interface required for the automated daily messaging task within the Magnus platforms.




Scope
The document details the flow of data, system interactions, and required logic between all involved platforms (e.g., Magnus core, CRM/Database, Messaging Service Provider, etc.) from the initiation of the task to the successful delivery of the daily messages.




Flow explanation
Platforms
This automation solution integrates two primary platforms:


Platform
	Role in DMA
	Key Data Entities
	Salesforce (SFDC)
	Source of Truth (SoT) for recipient lists and required personalization data.
	Custom Reports (Recipient Data), Contact/Lead Records.
	Glassix
	Messaging Service Provider (MSP) for template-based, multi-channel message delivery (primarily WhatsApp).
	Pre-Approved Message Templates
	The daily messaging tasks are mandated to execute a set of 9 distinct daily messaging tasks. Each task is defined by:
1. A specific SFDC Report (the recipient list and required data set).
2. A corresponding, pre-approved Glassix Message Template (the content).
  

Workflow 
3.1 Data Acquisition (SFDC)
1. Report Access: The Representative navigates to the specific Salesforce Report corresponding to the daily task.
2. Key Data Extraction: For each contact in the report, the Representative manually extracts the following mandatory data points required for the messaging service:
   * Contact Phone Number (Primary addressing field).
   * Personalization Fields (e.g., Full Name, Email, or other specific data points referenced in the message template).
3.2 Message Delivery (Glassix)
The Representative iterates through the list of recipients obtained in Step 3.1:
1. Conversation Initiation: The Representative navigates to the Glassix UI and initiates a new conversation.
2. Mandatory Metadata Entry (The Manual Input): The Representative must manually input or copy the following details into the designated Glassix conversation fields, using the data extracted from the SFDC Report:
   * Recipient Phone Number (Primary addressing field).
   * Customer Name (For conversation tracking in Glassix).
   * Conversation Subject (נושא).
3. Template Selection & Content Population: After creating the conversation shell, the Representative manually selects the pre-defined Glassix Message Template that is uniquely associated with the current daily task (e.g., satellite_connection_finish). The template then automatically populates with any embedded personalization fields (variables) based on the recipient's details already entered or maintained by Glassix.
4. Message Send: The Representative manually confirms and sends the final message.
3.3 Status Logging (Manual Traceability)
After successful delivery, the Representative is required to manually log the messaging activity back into the corresponding SFDC contact record for audit and traceability.
