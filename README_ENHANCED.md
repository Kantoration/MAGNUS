# ✅ README Enhanced - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced Non-Technical User Section ✅

**Before:** Basic 7-step list  
**After:** Comprehensive explanation with:

- Real-world example (Salesforce → Excel → WhatsApp)
- "What It Does NOT Do" section (sets expectations)
- Complete 5-step workflow diagram
- Simple terms explanation

**Key improvements:**

```
Added visual workflow:
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 1. FETCH TASKS      │ → Connects to Salesforce
│ 2. LOAD TEMPLATES   │ → Opens Excel file
│ 3. PROCESS TASKS    │ → Parallel processing (max 5)
│ 4. HANDLE RESULTS   │ → Success/Failure/Skip
│ 5. REPORT & CLEANUP │ → Summary + metrics
└─────────────────────┘

Added real-world example:
Salesforce Task → Excel Template → Final WhatsApp Message
(Shows actual transformation with Hebrew text)
```

### 2. Complete Architecture Documentation ✅

Added comprehensive technical section covering:

**a) Big-Picture Pipeline**
- CLI entry points (run, init, doctor, verify)
- Core services (Config, Logger, SF, Glassix, Templates, etc.)
- Orchestrator workflow (7 steps)

**b) Data Flow for Single Task**
- 7-step detailed breakdown
- From Salesforce fetch to metrics recording
- Shows exact transformations and validations

**c) Script Integration**
- How CLI calls orchestrator
- How services are constructed
- Stateful work encapsulation

**d) Concurrency Model**
- Controlled parallelism explanation
- p-map + Bottleneck rate limiting
- Visual diagram of task processing
- 5 key mechanisms explained

**e) Consistency Guarantees**
- At-least-once delivery with idempotency
- Salesforce as source of truth
- Correlation IDs for traceability
- Rate-limit telemetry

**f) Desynchronization Scenarios**
- 4 potential problems identified
- Mitigation strategies for each:
  1. Template cache staleness → mtime-based reload
  2. Token expiry → auto-refresh
  3. Partial failures → non-fatal updates
  4. Phone enumeration → generic errors

**g) TL;DR Summary**
- Clear answer to "Is it synchronized?"
- Lists all coordination mechanisms
- Explains why it's intentionally async
